## My process

I experimented with a mobile-first workflow. Starting with the HTML, I aimed for semantic HTML and paid attention to accessibility. From here, I set up CSS custom properties, working from the figma files provided and styled the component as closely as possible to the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A load about semantic HTML and accessibility. It's a huge topic, so there's plenty more to learn but this project gave me opportunity to think through the HTML more carefully and led to some very helpful new resource.

Also - the picture element. This was a really useful exercise in learning more about responsive images and the source HTML element.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to explore CSS methodologies around organising code and classes. The CSS file in this could definitely be improved in terms of organisation and precision!

### Useful resources

- [FED Mentor - Planning your HTML](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/) - This is a guide to the same build with best-practices for HTML. Having finished a version of the project, this was invaluable in
- [Scott O'Hara - Inclusively Hidden](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html#hiding-content-visually) - This is a great guide to including hidden elements that are still available to screen-readers.
